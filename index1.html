                    selling apples. We know what a good apple looks like and how they
                    are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
                    soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
                    drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir
                    which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
                    temperate fruits like apple for which the state is very famous
                    across globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit
                    bearing trees is soil, climate and environment which are highly
                    favorable and unparalleled in the province of Kashmir. Kashmiri
                    apples a unique look, taste, flavor, size and color.</p>
